## Description

Welcome to my LeetCode Solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to various coding problems from LeetCode, a popular platform for practicing coding skills and preparing for technical interviews.

I have always been passionate about problem-solving and algorithms, and LeetCode has been an excellent platform for me to challenge myself with a diverse range of coding questions. As I progress on my coding journey, I will be regularly updating this repository with my latest submissions and improving existing solutions.

## About the Solutions

Each solution is implemented in Java and is accompanied by a detailed explanation of the approach used to solve the problem. I believe that it's crucial to understand the thought process behind the code, and I have tried my best to provide clear and concise explanations for each solution.

The solutions are organized into folders based on the problem categories and difficulty levels on LeetCode. This helps keep the repository well-structured and easy to navigate.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the repository and go through the solutions. If you find any of the solutions helpful, you can use them as a reference for your own coding practice. However, I encourage you to try solving the problems on your own first before looking at the solutions.

If you have any questions, feedback, or suggestions, please don't hesitate to open an issue or contact me. I'm always eager to learn and improve, and your input is greatly appreciated.

## Disclaimer

While I have put in effort to ensure the correctness and efficiency of the solutions, it's important to note that there may be multiple approaches to solving a problem, and my solutions may not be the most optimal in all cases. I encourage you to explore alternative solutions and compare different approaches.
